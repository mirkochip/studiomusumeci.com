# Carmelo Mirko Musumeci. Think, build, dream.

I'm an Italian engineer, born in Catania, Sicily. My professional career is based in 10+ years of solid experience in software development, gained both in Italy and also somewhere else, around the world.

My key strengths is the automation of complex software systems, along with the design, development and deployment of back-end software layers. I know various programming languages and web frameworks and I love working applying the agile principles.

I'm curious by nature, since I was a kid I was affected by that kind of well known “syndrome” of disassembling and discovering the content hidden by every little box containing electronic components.
