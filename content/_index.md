# Carmelo Mirko Musumeci, an engineer, yes.. that kind of.

My professional career is based in 10+ years of solid experience in software development, gained both in Italy and other European Union countries.

My key strengths are the design, the development and the deployment of software systems, mainly back-end, through many programming languages and web frameworks using the agile principles.

Class 1984, Born in Catania (Sicily) and curious by nature, since I was a kid I was affected by that kind of well known “syndrome” of disassembling and discovering the content hidden by every little box containing electronic components.
